      <p>Thought you were busy??</p>
      <p>Becoming an organisational demi-god/goddess while maintaining your sanity and actually achieving the endless shit on your lists is marginally tricky.  Simply not having enough hours in the day to do everything on your list.
        Dev Academy has been amazing for teaching more about the importance of goal setting, planning, timeboxing and reflection. This gives space and time to ensure you're able to end the day with a sense of achievement - and even if you don't tick off the goal scoring every day, also the opportunity to reflect on why.
        Reflection is key for improvement and so that we don't make the same mistakes over and over again. (Einstein reckoned that was insanity).
      <b>        
      </b>
      <p>Understanding that it's okay to move between tasks, particularly if you're struggling to take in information or apply it, is really key to not beating yourself up.
      Having a plan which breaks the problem up into smaller sub-projects can make it much more  realistic and achievable.

      <p>Going around in circles..</p>
      <p>Today is one of those days where I feel like I'm going one step forward and two steps back. Instead of getting frustrated, I'm making a note of what the issue is and moving on to something different instead. In this case, I'm struggling with how show a placeholder what image it should use within the blog layout I've chosen. It's a good problem and I want to tackle it. However, my strategy of Google searching and going through some tutorials is not helping. So instead, I've been struck how useful it would be to have a navigation bar where I could store all of my learnings (technical) and also personal development. I will now focus on planning that and implementing this afternoon. Hopefully inspiration will strike, however, I will also put up a Slack message asking for help from my community</p>
