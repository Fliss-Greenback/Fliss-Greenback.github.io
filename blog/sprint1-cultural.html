<p><h2>Evidence:</h2></p>

<p>An achievement I’m really proud of: <br>Building a tech company as a non-coding founder with no money. One year on (through a global pandemic) we have a committed team of 7 volunteers all investing their time and effort into our project. We have launched Plantme.io and continue to develop the platform further. It’s taught me a lot about myself. Part of the reasoning for starting my own business and leading in the way I do is after 37 years working for other people and experiencing super awful shit leadership, particularly in my previous career of healthcare management. I understand from first hand experience how frustrating and bad for your health it is to work in a system and or for people that don’t care about people and don’t empower leadership from all team members.
</p>
<p>This has been highlighted to me on a number of occasions by my team along this journey. Several key members have commented on how it doesn’t feel like I’m their boss, but we’re all part of a team where everyone’s ideas, areas of interest and passions are taken into consideration. This is because I think when people are genuinely invested and feel like they’re important, and when you practice servant leadership you get the best work from them. This have been proved throughout this project - we’re working with the same core bunch of people who all get more than money out of working together (just as well because we don’t have any money!)
</p>
<h2>Personal Core Values:</h2>
<p>Integrity, compassion, understanding and wanting everyone to be equally heard and participate equally. </p>

Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. 

Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.

Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity: I’m a white English woman so this may be why I feel like I should constantly apologise for everything and myself. I think my relative privilege of being white, educated, with relatively well off parents, while also being female and shapely for all my life has formed an appreciation for what privilege looks like and also how stereotyping, prejudice and marginalisation feels horribly uncomfortable to those experiencing it. That juxtaposition has given me values around my actions and how leadership can promote fairness, equality and empower the same leadership in others (which ultimately leads to a different world if everyone does it). I think leadership is about behaving with compassion, empathy, respect with ears and eyes wide open, mouth quite often shut.
	My personality test is completely accurate around my level of idealism but age has given me a tad more realism around how utopian I allow myself to be (given the world we live in). I hope I’ve learnt how to employ my idealism, taking action over things that call to me - which I’m now doing in my female led and founded tech company. This was after 4 years of transcribing tech calls and hearing no female voices developing software, apps and technology for the future. It is my purpose to change that, alongside making solutions which promote and support climate action (and create big data on consumer trends). I can’t imagine doing anything else, therefore even the things that are hard and stressful are enjoyable and approached from the perspective of me as the leader of a company trying to change the world. I love learning and was lucky enough to study Cognitive Hypnotherapy a few years’ ago
    this.

    Personality Type:

    Personality Type:
The Mediator / Healer / Idealist
Mediators value authenticity, empathy, and harmony. These personalities tend to act with the best of intentions, and they are rightly proud of this trait. That said, they may feel isolated or discouraged when other people don’t share their idealism.

Mediators may feel directionless or stuck unless they connect with a sense of purpose for their lives. For many Mediators, this purpose has something to do with helping and uplifting others. Empathetic by nature, these personalities may feel other people’s suffering as if it were their own. This only strengthens their motivation to be of service.
Although Mediators might want to help everyone, they may need to focus their attention and energy on one worthy cause at a time. Otherwise, they can become so overwhelmed by all the problems they can’t fix that they’re tempted to give up on even trying. This is a sad sight for Mediators’ friends, who often depend on their hopeful outlook.
Fortunately, like flowers in the spring, Mediators’ creativity and idealism can bloom even after the darkest of seasons. Although they know the world will never be perfect, Mediators still care about making it better however they can. This quiet belief in doing the right thing may explain why these personalities so often inspire compassion, kindness, and beauty wherever they go.
STRENGTHS: Thoughtful – Mediators care about other people’s feelings. They adjust their actions if they think they might hurt anyone, even unintentionally. Kindheartedness flows from Mediator personalities, and everyone around them tends to benefit from it.
Generous – Mediators rarely enjoy succeeding at others’ expense. In general, people with this personality type want to share the good things in their lives. They value equality, and they want to ensure that every voice and perspective is heard.
Open-Minded – Mediators tend to give other people the benefit of the doubt. They aim to be tolerant of other people’s beliefs, lifestyles, and decisions. Generally speaking, Mediators support others’ right to live as they see fit – as long as no one is being hurt.
Creative – Mediators can often see things from unconventional perspectives. With their ability to make surprising and unexpected connections, it’s no wonder that many Mediators are drawn to creative pursuits and the arts.
Passionate – When an idea or movement captures Mediators’ imagination and speaks to their beliefs, they can give their whole heart to it. People with this personality type can be reserved or reticent, but that doesn’t diminish their strong feelings for a cause that matches their ideals.
Loyal to Their Values – Doing the right thing isn’t always easy, but Mediators’ far-reaching vision can help them stay the course. When they’re doing something meaningful, these personalities can have a sense of purpose or even courage that keeps them true to their values.

WEAKNESSES:
Overly Idealistic – Mediators can take their idealism too far. People with this personality type might idolize their romantic partner or expect every aspect of their job to feel meaningful. This can set them up for disappointment when reality falls short of their dreams.
Self-Critical – Mediators can expect so much from themselves that they inevitably fall short. When this happens, they may accuse themselves of being selfish or woefully inadequate. This self-criticism can erode their motivation to get things done and their willingness to prioritize necessary self-care.
Impractical – When something captures Mediators’ imagination, they can become so consumed by it that they neglect practical matters. Some people with this personality type even neglect eating or sleeping as they pursue their passion. Other Mediators can become so enamored with an idea that they’re afraid to act on it because they might not do it perfectly.
Emotionally Driven – Mediators can become so focused on their emotions that they lose track of what’s really going on. It can be a challenge for these personalities to slow down and make sure that their feelings aren’t preventing them from clearly seeing the facts of a situation.
Conflict-Averse – Mediators generally prefer to avoid conflict. They can put a great deal of time and energy into trying to please everyone. This desire to please others can drown out their own inner wisdom and make them painfully sensitive to even constructive criticism.
Difficult to Get to Know – Mediators are private, reserved, and sometimes self-conscious. This can make them somewhat difficult to really get to know. Their need for personal space can contribute to the guilt they feel for not giving more of themselves to those they care about.
