    <h1> The differences between HTML and CSS</h1>
    <br>
  <p>A website is like a house. The HTML is the blueprint (or architectural plans), the CSS is like the interior design (making it look visually pleasing and somewhere you want to spend time) and the JS is like the electricals, connecting up various elements to light the page up in a more fancy manner. The web browser is the builder. (I did steal this analogy but I like it!)</p>

    <h1> Control flow and loops</h1>
    <p>The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops. A typical script in JavaScript or PHP (and the like) includes many control structures, including conditionals, loops and functions.A loop is a sequence of statements which is specified once but which may be carried out several times in succession. The code "inside" the loop (the body of the loop) is obeyed a specified number of times, or once for each of a collection of items, or until some condition is met, or indefinitely.</p>

    <h1> What is the DOM?</h1>
    <p>The DOM (or Document Object Model) is an API defining a logical structure for documents and the way that a document is accessed and manipulated.
      With the Document Object Model, programmers can build documents, navigate their structure, and add, modify, or delete elements and content. Anything found in an HTML or XML document can be accessed, changed, deleted, or added using the Document Object Model, with a few exceptions.

      It identifies:
      <ul>
      <li>the interfaces and objects used to represent and manipulate a document</li>
      <li>the semantics of these interfaces and objects - including both behavior and attributes</li>
      <li>the relationships and collaborations among these interfaces and objects</li></ul>
    </p>

    <h1> The differences between accessing data from arrays and objects</h1>
    Arrays and objects are two ways of collecting data into a group. The data can be primitives (strings, numbers, booleans):
const namesArr = ['Danny', 'Donny', 'Joey', 'Jordan', 'Jonathan'];
const userObj = { name: 'Jamie', age: 42 };
…or they can be made of other arrays or objects:
const usersArr = [{ name: 'Jim', age: 4 }, { name: 'Al', age: 62 }];
const miscObj = { colors: ['orange', 'red'], numbers: [1, 2, 3] };
So, why would you pick one over the other? It comes down to ease-of-use and performance.

groups of similarly typed data, which you need ordered or want to manipulate as a batch are better suited for arrays, and grouped properties of a single entity are better suited for objects. Using the right data type isn’t always a clear choice, but the more you work with each data type, the more obvious it will be which one makes sense in any given situation.
   
<h1> Functions - purpose and uses</h1
>JavaScript provides functions similar to most of the scripting and programming languages. In JavaScript, a function allows you to define a block of code, give it a name and then execute it as many times as you want. A JavaScript function can be defined using function keyword. There are mainly two advantages of JavaScript functions. Code reusability: We can call a function several times so it save coding. Less coding: It makes our program compact. We don't need to write many lines of code each time to perform a common task.</p>
