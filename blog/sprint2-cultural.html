        <h1>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h1>
        <strong>Long term goals and/or career pathway? </strong>
              <p>Be really confident learning new languages and proficient in management and development of existing sites such as PlantMe.io and also incomplete works in progress such as our AR prototype built in Unity.</p>
        
        <strong>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning.</strong>
            Strengths: I try really hard at things I want to succeed in. I'm resourceful and resilient.
            Limitations: I find it hard to ask for help, partly down to my desire for perfect work and not wanting to appear really stupid.

        <strong>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</strong>
              <ul>
                  <li>Communication - particularly verbal, giving myself time and space to properly formulate understandable questions.</li>
                  <li>Empathy - being able to work effectively with everyone and anyone with understanding and support of their strengths and weaknesses.</li>
                  <li>Organisation and prioritising - becoming a super ninja at fitting everything in brilliantly and with ease...</li>
             </ul>

        <strong>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</strong>

            <p>Looking after my own wellness and health will be an important part of this and something my personality type is prone to disregard when we get really into something. I will therefore commit to eating well, sleeping properly, exercising daily and maintaining a healthy wellness routine to ensure I remain in physical, mental and emotional wellness and can give my best self.

            I also commit to sidelining my startup for the duration of bootcamp to be able to give my everything to being a part of the academy experience.

            I will commit to completing all requirements of the programme with my highest level of effort and passion, communicating clearly, regularly and openly with facilitators and peers to ensure everyone has a nice time working together and we get everything done successfully, on schedule.
            </p>

             

        
        <h1>Foundations Learning Plan</h1>
        
        <strong>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway? </strong>
         <p>Be proficient at learning development languages and confident to give things a good go so I can contribute/lead further development of Plantme.io and other future products as a coding founder. Becoming flexibly employable in a sector allowing me to use my existing skills and experience (alongside the new ones being generated) is also really attractive since this would potentially allow self-funding for my own business and startup.
         </p>
        
        <strong>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning.</strong> 
         <p>Strengths: Quick learner, high levels of motivation to succeed. Limitations: Impatient, time poor, sometimes struggle to complete tasks.
        </p>
            
        <strong>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</strong>
        <p>Letting people get to know me (as quite a serious introvert)</p>

        <strong>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</strong>
        This should include:
        An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives. 
        Prioritising EDA around the schedule I’ve agreed to. I have high levels of integrity and it bothers me deeply to not do what I say I will, when I say I will. To work productively, I will commit to and complete all required pre-learning and exploration to the agreed timeframes. Ensuring I timebox and stick to schedules in order to meet agreed targets. I will go the extra mile in making sure I reach the required standards and goals I have set myself.

        <strong>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you.</strong>
        <p> Go for a walk, meditate, do some yoga, talk to people I trust about any issues I’m having. Also confide in facilitators and team-mates if and when appropriate.
        </p>

        <strong>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</strong> 
        <p>I will make contact with facilitators and team mates in person, via Slack having reviewed the work programme for the upcoming week and identified any potential issues in plenty of time (e.g. not end of day Friday having discovered last minute issues). If I encounter problems, I will make contact immediately so that team-mates/facilitation team are updated.
        </p>

        <strong></strong>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team.</strong>
        <p> Help when I need it in the form of further information to explore or just headsup on the answer to problems I may be stuck with. Friendly interactions that support and encourage me but tell me upfront and be straight-up if I need to work harder in particular areas and improve. Guidance for what areas of learning to focus on to best achieve my outcome.
        </p>

        <strong>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.</strong>
        <p> Need a couple of hours a day at least to do my startup stuff. Also have a side hustle that I’m financially dependent on (transcription of technical R&D calls for tech companies in the UK) that is completely random in regards to commitment and turnaround time.
