      <h1> Problem Solving</h1>
      <br>
      <p><h2>Getting blocked on a simple problem.</h2>
        <h3>What was the problem?</h3>
        <p>Currently I seem to get blocked on lots of seemingly simple problems since am attempting to take in lots of new information which is ultimately like learning several new languages all together.
        Language has never been my strength in naturally picking it up and is something I have to try hard at. I found all of the Katas challenging to complete this week, from hard to seemed impossible.
        </p>
        <h3>What problem solving techniques were used?</h3>
        <p>Google remains my best friend for problem solving, revealing a variety of Youtube tutorials alongside W3Schools and Stack Overflow.
        Accessing support from my peers has also been vitally important. Slack channel for EDA has revealed lots of us are all struggling with how hard JavaScript is to get your head around and making the information stick. Working alongside my developers who have also helped me and guided me with in person learning - I really appreciate and benefit from a person explaining to me within the context of what we are trying to achieve.</p>
       
        <h3>How I felt throughout the process</h3>
        <p>I felt so stupid and that my brain really struggles to retain how to use a lot of the things we're learning.</p>
        <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
        <p>That attempting to learn something like programming this quickly is inherently difficult and involves so many hours of self-study, Googling and hopefully being taught and guided by peers to get understanding to stick.</p>
      </p>      
      <br>
      <p><h2>Solving a problem in an elegant way.</h2>
        
      <h3>What was the problem?</h3> 
      <p>In engineering, a solution may be considered elegant if it uses a non-obvious method to produce a solution which is highly effective and simple. An elegant solution may solve multiple problems at once, especially problems that are not thought to be inter-related.
        I'm really not sure I could profess to have solved problems elegantly yet - mine felt like cheating, particularly when even trying to understand the question being asked. I'm again thinking of this last week's challenges in the forms of Kata, most recently the gradebook and Fizzbuzz which were extremely challenging for me.
      </p>
      <h3>What problem solving techniques were used?</h3>
      I ended up Googling the problems we were set and finding a few references to the same exact problems with code. I copied and pasted the solutions and if they didn't work, tried to figure out why. 
      If they did work I also went back and refined my understanding of what was in the code to try and work out for future reference how everything has been constructed.
      <h3>>How I felt throughout the process</h3>
      Really stupid and like I am cheating through Googling the answers.
      <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
      I find it really hard not having personal instructions or someone to work alongside and share frustrations with alongside the self-study info being hard to retain. 

      My peers are probably the best form of support and I'm not using them enough and not being a part of the learning process for them either.

     <h2></h2>how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>Pseudocode - I find this difficult and haven't really used it as a process much</li>
      <li>Trying something - reasonably confident trying things, but if it doesn't work I can struggle with identifying why not and what I've done wrong.</li>
      <li>Rubber ducky method - haven't really tried this (insert picture of Gromit) but I shall for sure since talking through problems and resolving them in this way seems to be effective for others and I have no problem ultimately talking to myself.</li>
      <li>Reading error messages - getting better at this and have a much better understanding of at least the general direction of the error and whether it is syntax and missing something or that I have written non-sensical code.</li>
      <li>Console.logging - resonably happy but as with everything, have to google how to do it every time currently</li>
      <li>Googling - extremely competent and confident with finding solutions via Google (perhaps a bit too much so)</li>
      <li>Asking your peers for help - happy to do this but probably not making the most of the opportunity to connect and learn from my cohort - again from fear of looking stupid or being that person that doesn't have a clue!</li>
      <li>Asking coaches for help - I am terrible at this. I think it comes from feeling very much like I don't know anything and so talking to a coach will showcase this. I don't want to be that person that doesn't continue past Foundation!</li>
      <li>Improving your process with reflection - must try harder with this although I feel like reflecting on how I do things has become an inherent part of who I am over the past few years.</li>
